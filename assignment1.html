    <div id="summary">
        <p>The objective of this assignment was to make a 24" by 36" poster about either our life under covid-19 or how we see the future of design. However there was a catch. We couldn't use any design applications, like Adobe.</p>
    </div>  
    <div id="reflection">
        <p>I was really struggling with this assignment. I couldn’t come up with a solid idea  and when I did have an idea I couldn’t illustrate the idea the way I wanted to. There was also a lot of external factors that made this project really hard me. I was not satisfied with my final product but I just wanted to be done with the project. So I simply tweaked the project based on critiques, and called it done.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="explan1">
         <p>I chose to go the direction of life under/with covid, and how so much has been happening in the world that it can be overwhelming. But at the same time I wanting to depict the feeling of slowly becoming numb to big news as well because of this reason. Therefore my goal was to create a choatic poster with multiple news articles headlines. This process was very time consuming and made me remember a lot of events from the last two years that I forgot. I experimented with both pages and my desktop. The pages version is my favourite, as it has the most common words watermarked overtop of the news articles, adding to the chaos. I attempting to do the same thing with the desktop version but it appeared out of place.</p>

    <div id="explan2">
        <p>More process pieces were made but never finished as I did not believe they looked good. For example I had started a piece where I would layer the news articles on top of each other, however it became a jumbled mess of type and colour rather quickly, so I trashed it instead of continuing it. There are also more screenshots from my desktop as I was exploring other ways to depict it. But I found that this was was more chaotic. I do still have those picture and have included them below. They were ruled out as they were not chaotic enough, as they were too organized.</p>
