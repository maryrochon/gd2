<h2 id="title1">Sketch 1</h2>
<p id="bodyp1">This sketch has three ellipses. Two circles that match the background colour that overlay a third black oval like ellipse. It took a lot of trial and error to create this abstract looking ’s’.</p>
<iframe id="sket2" src="https://editor.p5js.org/mary.rochon/full/Ys25Vd3JP" width="1000px" height="1042px"></iframe>
<h2 id="title2">Sketch 2</h2>
<img src="images/sketch-02.png" id="sketch2"></a>
<p id="bodyp2">My second sketch is based on the in class demonstration. To try and change it up a bit I played around with the random function and the size of the ellipse tool. This is an interactive sketch.</p>
<iframe id="sket3" src="https://editor.p5js.org/mary.rochon/full/X4I9oVLf-" width="1000px" height="1042px"></iframe>
<h2 id="title3">Sketch 3</h2>
<p id="bodyp3">This was a bit of a happy accident. The background was based on the in class demonstration, but it went wrong and didn’t create a static background. The actual ’s’ is created by two while loops that we learned in class. Both have been rotated and stretched to make the a shape. This took Looooooooooots of trial and error to figure out the right translation and rotation.</p>
<iframe id="sket4" src="https://editor.p5js.org/mary.rochon/full/upLnw9LU2" width="1000px" height="1042px"></iframe>
<h2 id="title4">Sketch 4</h2>
<p id="bodyp4">I took what I learnt from the previous sketch and made a more discernible ’s’. To do this, I had to adjust the x and y coordinates in the rect function, to get the arc I want, then use translate instead to move the while loop.</p>
<iframe id="sket5" src="https://editor.p5js.org/mary.rochon/full/e2_I3oFXk" width="1000px" height="1042px"></iframe>
<h2 id="title5">Sketch 5</h2>
<p id="bodyp5">I really liked the while loops, so again I was playing with the size of the arc on the page, the shape used and the size of the shape itself.</p>
<iframe id="sket6" src="https://editor.p5js.org/mary.rochon/full/S4vUFcz9_" width="1000px" height="1042px"></iframe>
<h2 id="title6">Sketch 6</h2>
<img src="images/sketch-06.0.png" id="sketch-06"></a>
<p id="bodyp6">This sketch, is based on a p5 reference that when you draw slowly makes what you draw look kind of 3D. Again like the 2nd sketch this is an interactive sketch.</p>
<iframe id="sket7" src="https://editor.p5js.org/mary.rochon/full/C4JbhSS_M" width="1000px" height="1042px"></iframe>
<h2 id="title7">Sketch 7</h2>
<p id="bodyp7">This is based on a talk I had with a fellow classmate. They were wondering how I did my first sketch and how they could do that for their letter. I showed how this could be done with the rect function for more linear letters, hence resulting in a linear ’s’.</p>
<iframe id="sket8" src="https://editor.p5js.org/mary.rochon/full/6F7catmfs" width="1000px" height="1042px"></iframe>
<h2 id="title8">Sketch 8</h2>
<p id="bodyp8">This sketch is based upon the in class demonstration. I just increased the size of the first ’s’ and added a thin red stroke to rotating ’s’ so that when the ’s’ is done rotating it will still stand out. </p>
<iframe id="sket9" src="https://editor.p5js.org/mary.rochon/full/EkvG_zN9r" width="1000px" height="1042px"></iframe>
<h2 id="title9">Sketch 9</h2>
<p id="bodyp9">This is also based on the in class demonstration. I added a second if statement and had them both stop when it looked like they were 3 quarters of the way complete. It took some trial and error to figure out how to get the blue if statement to go in the opposite direction.</p>
<iframe id="sket10" src="https://editor.p5js.org/mary.rochon/full/3NeELLllh" width="1000px" height="1042px"></iframe>
<h2 id="title10">Sketch 10</h2>
<p id="bodyp10">Here I was going through the p5 reference page and seeing how I could apply any of them to my letter. I used the curveVertex reference and played around with where to put points. It was not as easy as I thought it would be.</p>
<iframe id="sket11" src="https://editor.p5js.org/mary.rochon/full/zoZBdMEjO" width="1000px" height="1042px"></iframe>
<h2 id="title11">Sketch 11</h2>
<p id="bodyp11">This sketch forever reminds me of Shrek because of my font choice. I used the p5 text reference this time, and this is where I found out the z-axis is a thing that exists. I know prefer using, or adding it with the x or y axis.</p>
<iframe id="sket12" src="https://editor.p5js.org/mary.rochon/full/3ecnII-Ov" width="1000px" height="1042px"></iframe>
<h2 id="title12">Sketch 12</h2>
<p id="bodyp12">Behold a deconstructed ’s’ using the arc tool. I am unfamiliar with radians so this took a lot of trial and area to get arc that I am satisfied with. I opted to rotate some as I couldn’t figure out how to change the starting point.</p>
<iframe id="sket13" src="https://editor.p5js.org/mary.rochon/full/dwxnipI1b" width="1000px" height="1042px"></iframe>
<h2 id="title13">Sketch 13</h2>
<p id="bodyp13">After pointing my toe in with WEBGL(3D) in my 11th sketch, I wanted to try and construct a ’s’ using boxes. I used the lesson from class about classes and made the width an interactive part of this sketch. The lower the x-coordinate the thinner boxes are, and higher the x-coordinate the heavier the boxes are.</p>
<iframe id="sket14" src="https://editor.p5js.org/mary.rochon/full/TTAO4Tj2C" width="1000px" height="1042px"></iframe>
<h2 id="title14">Sketch 14</h2>
<p id="bodyp14">Uses the same class from the previous sketch I used the lesson from class and applied it to this sketch, with the switching colours and rotating ’s’. However I made it rotate across all axis.</p>
<iframe id="sket15" src="https://editor.p5js.org/mary.rochon/full/xpUdmzSYr" width="1000px" height="1042px"></iframe>
<h2 id="title15">Sketch 15</h2>
<p id="bodyp15">This sketch is inspired by the 13th sketch. This time the height changes, but it is controlled by a slider in the top left corner. I learned this from the p5 reference as well.</p>
<iframe id="sket16" src="https://editor.p5js.org/mary.rochon/full/rhYc27AgX" width="1000px" height="1042px"></iframe>
<h2 id="title16">Sketch 16</h2>
<p id="bodyp16">Clearly I really this boxy ’s’. Here I experimented with the slider some more. However there is three and they all interact with each other. They respectful represent r, b, and g from the colour codes. Therefore moving them will change the letter’s colour.</p>
<iframe id="sket17" src="https://editor.p5js.org/mary.rochon/full/TMtrihx_J" width="1000px" height="1042px"></iframe>
<h2 id="title17">Sketch 17</h2>
<p id="bodyp17">Following in the same direction of the boxes, I created the letter also with cylinders and played around with their sixes. It takes a lot of trial and error to get the cylinders to properly align. In addition to simply just displaying the letter, this sketch is interactive due to the addition of the obitControl function. So you can drag around the letter and scroll on it as well.</p>
<iframe id="sket18" src="https://editor.p5js.org/mary.rochon/full/cjUtmQCs5" width="1000px" height="1042px"></iframe>
<h2 id="title18">Sketch 18</h2>
<p id="bodyp18">Playing with the shape from the previous, I opted for it to rotate on its own. Here I added all three rotate functions. During these rotations is when I noticed I hadn’t been careful when putting the shape together and there was some small mistakes that I had to correct like cylinders not actually touching or going over the edge.</p>
<iframe id="sket19" src="https://editor.p5js.org/mary.rochon/full/JopZCKD43" width="1000px" height="1042px"></iframe>
<h2 id="title19">Sketch 19</h2>
<p id="bodyp19">Here I used the particle function that we learned in class to form an ’s’. This took a LOT of trial and error and restarting as the shape was originally too small. I learnt that I needed to individually name and call each fountain which was such a pain.</p>
<iframe id="sket20" src="https://editor.p5js.org/mary.rochon/full/zhJm8hiWU" width="1000px" height="1042px"></iframe>
<h2 id="title20">Sketch 20</h2>
<p id="bodyp20">So this one isn’t really working on the website for some reason. It is supposed to respond to sound. I will attach a link to a separate website where you can view it. However this too is based on a lesson learned in class.</p>
<a href="https://editor.p5js.org/mary.rochon/full/zhJm8hiWU"><p id="link20">Here is the link to see the sketch in action</p></a>
<iframe id="sket21" src="https://editor.p5js.org/mary.rochon/full/X6z1eydez" width="1000px" height="1042px"></iframe>
<h2 id="title21">Sketch 21</h2>
<p id="bodyp21">I used the same function as the previous sketch, and just added a few options objects that removed some of the points. Hence making the shape more abstract. I experimented with rotate and various other interactive functions, however I believe this sketch is better static.</p>
