        <h2> Reading Discussions </h2>
    </div> 

    <h3 id="rd1">Reading Discussion I: Tool Standards and Poetics</h3>
   <div class="qrd1">
    <p>1. The two articles both articulate an ethical problem related to their topic (industry-standard design tools & the current scale and state of open-source tech). Define what you consider to be the authors positions in relation to these two topics and how they overlap. What connections can you draw between these two articles? Do they prescribe solutions that are pertinent to each other? </p>
    <p>2. Aside from the mastery of certain digital tools and programs, what skills do you see as integral to your graphic design practice?</p>
    </div>
    <div class="ansrd1">
    <p>Both of these two articles seem to heavily support the use of open-source platforms and/codes. However, Gavin Mueller acknowledges that the open-source infrastructure is collapsing, and he is more in support of maintaining it. While also developing an "organized democratic tech sector" (Mueller). John-Patrick Hartnett acknowledges that, us, as graphic designers are too reliant on tools that we have no control/power over (Adobe and Apple), and he would rather that we use open-source software, as it gives us more freedom. So if the tech sector maintains open-source software, like Lehni's paper.js software, maybe we wouldn't have to rely so heavily on Adobe and Apple.</p>
    <p>As much as tools and programs are important to graphic design, they are nothing without a thorough understanding of design principles. I believe that typography is also important integral as it's important to choose the right font, placement and everything has to be legible when required.</p>
    </div>
    <h3 id="rd2">Reading Discussion II:Olia Lialina — Turing Complete User & Laurel Schwulst — My website is a shifting house next to a river of knowledge...</h3>
    <div class="qrd2">
    <p> 1. What do you think of Lialina’s definition of the universal user? Do you think it is a useful category for understanding Schwulst’s argument advocating for individual websites over platforms? Explain why and provide at least 1 example. </p>
    <p> 2. What kind of computer user are you? Draw on concepts from Lialina’s text, and integrate a quotation in your answer. Make use of metaphor, if you can, to describe your experience online (à la Schwulst).</p>
    </div>
    <div class="ansrd2">
    <p>1. From what I understood the universal user achieves their desired results without using an app or program specifically designated for that task. This is very reminiscent of our assignment 1 as we aren't allowed to use design software. Thus, pushing us to be more like the universal user. Schulwulst's argument against big platforms and in favor of individual websites is reinforced within the universal user. Take Lialina's example of how the universal user could send a tweet; they would use Live Journal instead of Twitter to "inform the world about your breakfast" (Lialina). This shows a push away from a larger platform for a smaller website, where the user could have even made their own website.</p>
    <p>2. I'd guess I'm a "real user (those who pay money to use the system) (Lialina), as I'm paying to use Adobe and other software. Unfortunately, my experience online is very similar to Schwulst's idea of the shelf, with the idea of switching out the objects to stay current, and as I learn more. However, the shelf (software in this case) can easily be removed at any time, causing everything to fall to the ground. </p>
    </div>
    <h3 id="rd3">Reading Discussion III: Code, letters, logic, play.</h3>
    <div class="qrd3">
    <p>3. Many of the tools and languages mentioned by Just van Rossum in the talk are open-source in nature. Find 3 other unique languages/software/tools that are open source. Describe how you could apply open source principles to your design process.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="ansrd3">
    <p>3. Just van Rossum really focussed on what was possible with his program Drawbot and the associated language Python. Therefore I wanted to focus on other open-source programs and languages. After doing some research I discovered "Atom" (https://atom.io/), developed by Github, which is another text editor program, however, it allows multiple people to be collaborating on a code. The layout is very similar to Visual Studio Code, but it appears to be more interactive. According to the website, one can make packages of code and publish it for others to use. "AngularJS" (https://angularjs.org/) is a tool that allows you to use javascript within the Html document. The third program I found was "Bootstrap" (https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.4/) which aids in making websites, with the help of examples and set layouts. One can have the start a website and get the code already made for a navigation bar from the examples. These open sources programs/languages/tools help make coding easier for individual users and allow them to easily seek help. One can apply these open source principles by collaborating on code and sharing one's code. It also allows for a good amount of experiments.</p>
    </div>
    <h3 id="rd4">Reading Discussion IV: In Free Fall, Hito Steyerl</h3>
    <div class="qrd4">
    <p>2. What do you make of Steyerl’s point that linear perspective privileges the individual while also lessening one’s humanity by rendering that individual view according to scientific principles? Is it possible to maintain both a humanist and technological perspective?</p>
    </div>  
    <div class="ansrd4">
    <p>2. From what I understood surveillance is constantly happening, be it from Google, drones, or just a random security camera. And due to ever-evolving technology, a lot of surveillance comes from above, which is called an aerial or vertical perspective. When surveillance is taken from an aerial perspective, it typically gets rid of the stable ground or the linear perspective. Instead, an imaginary stable ground is made. However, there is a vast power complex when one uses aerial perspective. It can be regarded as the viewer looking down on those in the video and thinking the viewer is superior to the people. Aerial perspective comes across as even more invasive than your typical everyday surveillance cameras, with Steyerl describing it as "militaristic as it is pornographic" (Steyerl), with the viewer being even more detached yet with more knowledge of the people they watch. From an aerial perspective, people don't know they are being watched unless they are filming for a project. Which is one of the reasons I believe that Steryerl says that if aerial surveillance becomes more commonplace that it will be our demise.</p>
